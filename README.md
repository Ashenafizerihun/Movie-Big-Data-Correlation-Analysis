Description

The project demonstrates the complete workflow of data analysis:

Data Cleaning: Preparing and cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and ensure accuracy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraging scatter plots, regression plots, and heat maps to uncover patterns and relationships.

Correlation Analysis: Computing correlation coefficients to quantify the strength and direction of relationships between numerical features.

Visualization: Using Python libraries to create visually compelling plots that summarize the data effectively.

Tools and Technologies

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

NumPy: For numerical computations.

Seaborn: For advanced data visualization, including scatter plots, regression plots, and heat maps.

Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and publication-quality visualizations.
